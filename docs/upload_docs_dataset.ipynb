    "## Starting your environment (Docker or Local)\n",
    "DiveDB can be run either within a Docker container or directly on your local machine. Both approaches rely on the same .env configuration file for environment variables, but differ in how file paths are handled. Docker will more closely match a cloud-hosted environment, but local runs are quicker and easier to set up.\n",
    "\n",
    "###Option 1: Run Jupyter server with Docker\n",
    "\n",
    "To launch the server using Docker, open the Docker Desktop app and run the following command at the root of the project:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ make up\n",
    "```\n",
    "This command will launch the Jupyter server using the environment variables defined in your .env file.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Understanding expected file paths (Docker):\n",
    "\n",
    "For local uploads in Docker, DiveDB expects the following variables to be set in your .env file:\n",
    "- `LOCAL_DATA_PATH`: The path to the local data directory (source of data to be uploaded).\n",
    "- `LOCAL_ICEBERG_PATH`: The path to the local iceberg directory (destination of data to be uploaded).\n",
    "- `CONTAINER_DATA_PATH`: The path that the container will see for the data directory.\n",
    "- `CONTAINER_ICEBERG_PATH`: The path that the container will see for the iceberg directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "The “LOCAL_” paths refer to folders on your machine. The “CONTAINER_” paths define how those folders are mounted inside the container. We recommend keeping the “CONTAINER_” paths consistent with the values provided in .env.example.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Uploads to S3 (Docker):\n",
    "\n",
    "If uploading to S3, the following variables must also be defined:\n",
    "- `S3_ENDPOINT`: The endpoint of the S3 bucket.\n",
    "- `S3_ACCESS_KEY`: The access key of the S3 bucket.\n",
    "- `S3_SECRET_KEY`: The secret key of the S3 bucket.\n",
    "- `S3_BUCKET`: Just the name of the S3 bucket.\n",
    "\n",
    "These values are used regardless of whether you run DiveDB in Docker or locally.\n",
    "\n",
    "When is the server ready?\n",
    "\n",
    "You’ll know the server is ready when you see logs like the following:\n",

    "\n",
    "To connect to the Jupyter server in your notebook, follow these steps:\n",
    "1. Click the \"Select Kernel\" button at the top right of the page.\n",
    "1. Pick the \"Select another kernel\" option in the dropdown menu.\n",
    "1. Pick the \"Existing Jupyter Server\" option in the dropdown menu.\n",
    "1. Now we need to connect to the Jupyter server.\n",
    "    - If you previously connected to the Jupyter server\n",
    "        - Pick the \"localhost\" option in the dropdown menu (or whatever you named it prior)\n",
    "    - If you have not connected to the Jupyter server before\n",
    "        - Pick the \"Enter the URL of the running Jupyter server\" option in the dropdown menu.\n",
    "        - Enter http://localhost:8888/jupyter\n",
    "        - Give it a name you'll remember (like \"Local DiveDB Jupyter Server\")\n",
    "1. Press the \"Reload\" icon in the top right of the dropdown menu to see the latest kernel.\n",
    "1. Pick the \"Python 3\" option in the dropdown menu.\n",
    "\n",
    "This will ensure you execute the Jupyter notebook in the correct environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Option 2: Run Jupyter server locally (no Docker)\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also run the server directly on your machine, without Docker.\n",
    "\n",
    "The environment variables from .env will still be used—consider loading them into your shell manually (e.g., using dotenv or exporting them yourself), or structure your notebook to load them directly with python-dotenv.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Understanding expected file paths (Local):\n",
    "\n",
    "If running locally (outside Docker), the following variables are still expected:\n",
    "- `LOCAL_DATA_PATH`: The path to the local data directory.\n",
    "- `LOCAL_ICEBERG_PATH`: The path to the local iceberg directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike the Docker setup, the container-specific variables (CONTAINER_DATA_PATH, CONTAINER_ICEBERG_PATH) are not used. Any paths referenced in your code should point directly to the LOCAL_ paths.\n",
    "\n",
    "Uploads to S3 (Local):\n",
    "\n",
    "S3 configuration remains unchanged. The same variables must be set:\n",
    "- `S3_ENDPOINT`: The endpoint of the S3 bucket.\n",
    "- `S3_ACCESS_KEY`: The access key of the S3 bucket.\n",
    "- `S3_SECRET_KEY`: The secret key of the S3 bucket.\n",
    "- `S3_BUCKET`: The name of the S3 bucket.\n",
