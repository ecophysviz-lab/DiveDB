    "We connect to our datastores using the `DuckPond` class. DuckPond is a wrapper around a DuckDB connection with access to both our Metadata Database and our measurements stored in Delta Lake. The ability to query both sources of data from a single connection is useful for quickly accessing data for analysis.\n",

    "### Using the DuckPond `get_delta_data` method\n",
    "DuckPond's `get_delta_data` method constructs a query based on the parameters you pass to it and returns a DuckDB DataFrame. It is useful for quickly accessing data for analysis. It takes the following optional parameters:\n",
    "- `labels`: A string or list of data labels to query.\n",
    "- `logger_ids`: A string or list of logger IDs to query.\n",
    "- `animal_ids`: A string or list of animal IDs to query.\n",
    "- `deployment_ids`: A string or list of deployment IDs to query.\n",
    "- `recording_ids`: A string or list of recording IDs to query.\n",
    "- `date_range`: A tuple of start and end dates to query.\n",
    "- `limit`: The maximum number of rows to return.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `get_delta_data` method returns a [DuckDB DuckDBPyConnection](https://duckdb.org/docs/api/python/reference/#duckdb.DuckDBPyConnection) which can be used to convert the data in many different formats including the following ([see documentation for a full list](https://duckdb.org/docs/api/python/conversion#result-conversion-duckdb-results-to-python))\n",
